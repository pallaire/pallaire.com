Today, we drove around the Bay Area to get to the coast. We drove up to Gualala, a place where we almost bought a house. It's really a nowhere on the coast. About 2h north of SF. 

A lot of campground were already full but we knew where we were going. Anchor Bay Campground. We are camping just by the beach. 

Red played in the water for a long time. The water here is freezing cold. 

We took amazing pictures of the Milky Way. The best nightly sky of my life.
