We are embarking in a new road trip, the second one for Bloom, our self built Sprinter van. The goal of the trip is to get to Vacouver BC to meet with my wife's dad, and to meet with my childhood friend, Greg. This is going to take a a couple of weeks for the round trip.

Starting point: San Diego, CA

Turn around point: Vancouver, BC

Today, was an highway only type of day. Trying to reach the coast north of san francisco asap because we have seen this part of California more than once.

We have started a new todo list of things to change or repair in the van:

- Skeeky sound coming from the sink cabinet
- Replace the fan with a Dometic RTX 2000

Driving distance today: about 400 miles
Sleeping in a parking lot of a TA Travel Center in Santa Nella.
