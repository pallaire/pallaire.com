Today we left the coast for Portland. It was mostly forest drive. Before getting on the road, of course, we went to the beach one last time for the dogs. 

The we reached Portland. We visited the Old Town, went to Voodoo Doughnut. We were lucky, parking in front and no line up. Don't eat before going there. They are amazing. I took an hibiscus one and a grape one. Portland as a huge homeless people problem, worst then I have seen in SF or LA. 

After that we drove around town and found a campground in the suburbs. Barton Campground. Ok place, we got a good spot. Understaffed.
