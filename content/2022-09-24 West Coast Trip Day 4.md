Quick drive north on the coast to Fort Bragg. Found a camping on the side of a cliff overlooking the ocean. Harbor RV Camp. This is basically a parking lot, but the view was great. On the really bad side was that we were located next to entry of the harbor, which is signaled by fog horn sounding every 30 seconds.

Took some picture of the stars, but not as nice as the city have some light pollution.
