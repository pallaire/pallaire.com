More talking, some coffee, a couple of poutines. 

Drive north with Greg to his hideout spot in North Vancouver. Did some shopping at the worst Walmart ever. 

Then we said our goodbyes and started our way back south across the border. 

We are sleeping Birch Bay State Park just across the border. Nice sunset. Quiet spot.
