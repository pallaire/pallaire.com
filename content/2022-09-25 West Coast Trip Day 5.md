Early this morning we did a stop at a beach for the dogs. This beach was populated by crabs. 

Fort Bragg to Eureka by the way of the Avenue of the Giants. Wow what an amazing drive under the giant sequoias. 

Lots of twisties today, enough to get dizzy. Some turns are so sharp that the speed limit is 10mph. 

We found a farm market with Apple cider and crazy rich chocolate cookies. 

Tomorrow we'll sleep in Oregon.
