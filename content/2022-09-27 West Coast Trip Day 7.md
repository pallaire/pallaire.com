Driving from Banddon to Beverly Beach. 

We started by exploring the campground beach, it was almost like being on a desert planet. Beach as far as you can see. 

We stopped at Dunes City for some game time. Ran up a dune, wow, that was exhausting. Took out the drone for some aerial footage. I managed to crash the drone in tall grass and to lose one is Red's ball as well. 

We are once again camping in a state campground for the cheap price of $21. Getting our spot was difficult, the ranger office was closed until 5pm. So we picked a spot at random and paid for it afterwards. 

Tomorrow direction Portland.
