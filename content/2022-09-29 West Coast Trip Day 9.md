After a good night of sleep under the rain, we woke up to better weather, but still cloudy. We drove to Multnomah Falls where the rain picked up a lot. We got some great shots. 

We drove further north into Washington State. We went to the back side of Mount Rainier, but we failed to see it du to clouds. 

Red got to see elks for the first time, she was excited and interested. 

We are sleeping in the shittiest campground but at least we got to do our laundry.
