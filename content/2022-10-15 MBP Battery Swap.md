Today I have change my old, but still super useful Mac Book Pro 13" from 2017. It's a Core Duo i5 with 8GB of Ram. This machine is still used weekly at home to connect to the TV to watch some shows. 

The process of changing the battery is pretty straight forward, the instructions are easy to follow, but there is a single challenge that you need to be prepared for if you want to attempt this. The old battery is glued to the chassis, prying it off is really really tough. The instructions says to use some alchool to soften the glue, which help a bit, but still, be careful when doing it, you could rip off some important cables when it let go. I was lucky and everything went fine. This is not a 10 minutes job. Take your time.
