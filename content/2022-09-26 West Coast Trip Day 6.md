We played in a dangerous beach in the morning. Where they warn about the water being dangerous with survival unlikely. We stayed away from the water. 

We made it to Oregon. 

We saw the Face Rock on an amazing beach in Banddon. 

Tonight we're sleeping in a State Campground, Bullard Beach State Park. Close to Banddon, OR. At the campground we were greeted with some wild turkeys. Great spot, nice campground. 

Tomorrow we continue north. We are modifying the plan a bit, we have experience enough twisties for a life time. We will probably cut out Port Angeles and the area.
