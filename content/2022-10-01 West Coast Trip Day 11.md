Slow morning at the campground. We tried to reach the beach but it was too far out. 

We got back on the road for Vancouver. At the border 2 cars were stalled in the Nexus lane. But we made it through in about 15 minutes. No questions asked at the gate. 

First emergency after the border ... a poutine ! Meh ðŸ«¤ I guess I'm getting over it. 

Great afternoon with AmÃ©lie's father and Greg at talking about vans, travel, and life. 

Sleeping stealth in the city.
