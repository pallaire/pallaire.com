This week I started to experiment with 3D Printing. I had been looking at that for a while. 

I chose to go with resin printing because I liked the details that came how of that. Also, I don't like the look of the filament base print where you can see every layer of the print. But in the end it might have been simpler to start with filament print. 

Resin printing is not easy, not that the other type is easer, but playing with the resin is a bit messy and smelly. 

Quote from Reddit: *"Don't think of it as a printer, think of it as a drunk robot with a hot glue gun."*

I was hesitant to go with resin until I saw that now there is some plant based water washable resin, this sounded right. 

I got a ton of failed prints, but in the end I got some that looked ok. The challenge is not limited to the printing, but to the prep as well. You need to learn to design your items, to export them, to align them, and finally to add the proper support.

I will get back to it in a couple of weeks, now I on to another project, adding an AC to the van, and redoing the whole electrical system...
